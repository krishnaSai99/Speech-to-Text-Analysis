# Speech-to-Text Analysis  

## Overview  
This project implements a **Speech-to-Text pipeline** using **Hugging Face transformer models**, designed to transcribe audio files accurately and efficiently. It extends functionality by providing real-time outputs such as transcription, summarization, sentiment analysis, audio classification, and named entity recognition.  

## Features  
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles diverse languages and noisy audio datasets with high accuracy.  
- **Real-Time Outputs**: Includes transcription, summaries, sentiment detection, and entity recognition.  
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Deployed via **Streamlit** for seamless audio file uploads and immediate analysis.  

## Objectives  
- Enhance audio transcription efficiency and accuracy in noisy conditions.  
- Deliver comprehensive audio data insights for real-world applications.  

## How It Works  
1. Processes audio files using transformer-based models for transcription.  
2. Applies additional analyses like summarization, sentiment detection, and entity extraction.  
3. Output results via an intuitive, real-time web interface.
